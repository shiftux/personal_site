    <h4>Motivation</h4>
    <p>
        Summer 2020 is Covid season. You spend a lot of time at home surrounded by very few, select people. One of two things usually tends to happen in such a scenario: you either grow apart or you grow closer... In our case it was the latter, which is around the time I decided to "put a ring on it" (in the eternal words of Beyoncé). Personally I am the kind of person who gives value to handmade things, so for me it was clear that if she got a ring, I would do it myself.
    </p>
    <h4>The ring</h4>

        Not far from where I live there is a metal shop specialized in large metal constructions and welding, I asked one of the workers there if they had some cylindrical scrap steel piece laying around. There wasn't but the guy was nice enough to cut me a 8cm piece, more than I needed. This I took to my dad's place, where in his basement he has a small lathe. <br>
        During my Bachelor studies in mechanical engineering I had a 4 week introduction on turning, milling, welding and bending. That was 13 years ago... In the meantime I had not done much on a lathe, so I watched a couple of videos and got familiar with turning speeds and tools again, before I started the project. With a few pointers from my younger brother on tool setting it was actually surprisingly easy. In the end the ring came out beautifully and very much as I had hoped it would! <br>
        For measures I had a look at a ring that was laying around at home and had seen hear wearing a couple of times already. Note that here very small differences play a huge role, an inner diameter difference of 0.5mm can be the difference between very comfortable fit and needing to force it on and use lube to get it off.

        I was not gonna offer her a self-made ring in a bought box. So the next step of the project was to make a nice box to offer the ring in. There is a buzz saw standing next to the lathe in my dad's basement, so that's what I used. <br>
        The trouble here was that I wanted the edges of the box to join in a 45° angle instead of just glueing one side wall of the box next to the other. While it looks much nicer in my opinion it's also a lot harder to achieve, especially if your saw has very limited measurement settings. It ended up being a bit of a trial and error approach to get it about right and I ended up having to file the pieces just a little bit for the final fit. <br>
        Using a sponge and some soft felt sheet I made a lid-inlay to hold the ring in place. Wrapping it all with a lovely red ribbon and the gift was ready.

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
    <p>
        The short conclusion is: she said yes, it worked! <br>
        Having a closer look at the work and outcome, I am very happy with the ring. It came out beautifully and is looking exactly as I had imagined. This was an especially encouraging outcome since, as mentioned, I have little experience on lathes. <br>
        In the end the box took almost as much time as the ring. I think if I had to redo that I would try to find a shop with a couple of more precise tools to get the angles and measurements inside the angles to a better fit. Nevertheless the box looks lovely and the very slight imperfection in the corners actually gives it that hand-made look and feel.
